# My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) [2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/)

I am mostly using the [Flix programming language](https://flix.dev/) this year. 
Some days may include additional implementations in other languages such as Ruby or Haskell or whatever else I felt like writing that day.

## How to run

For example to run day 1 solution (you will need to install java (ewww) and download [flix.jar](https://github.com/flix/flix/releases)):
```
$ cd day01
$ java -jar flix.jar solution.flix
```
